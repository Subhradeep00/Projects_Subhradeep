                                                    ***Greetings Techie***

             This is a home automation device project using which one can handle all the home appliances remotely.
               Keep an eye on the surrounding starting from temperature, humidity to any movement on that place.

                              I have uploaded some Images on ReadMe.md, Don't forget to check it out.
                                                        ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚

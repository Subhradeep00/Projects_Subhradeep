                    This is a rover that can detect obsticals in it's way and avoide them to go forword.
                                  It acts on it's own and no need for a controller.

                   Don't forget to checkout this repository and collect the source code for your own Rover.
                                                  Collect the code
                                           Edit as per your requirements
                                                Open it to the world!

                    This is a rover that can detect obsticals in it's way and avoide them to go forword.
                                  It acts on it's own and no need for a controller.

                   Don't forget to checkout this repository and collect the source code for your own Rover.
                                                  Collect the code
                                           Edit as per your requirements
                                                Open it to the world!

                    I'm attaching some Video and Pictures of my own Rover, do check out if you like.
